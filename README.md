### Problem Statement

The aviation industry is a critical sector in the economy as it facilitates travel, business, and military.  Despite significant advancements in technology and safety, accidents still occur which result in injuries and fatalities.

The overall safety commercial aviation has improved over the years but there remains a pressing need to reduce the incidences of accidents and fatalities and mitigate their impact.  Can we conclude which airlines are likely to have an injury or fatality?  Do particular airlines need to focus on more safety measures than others?  The need for answers to these questions would help benefit stakeholders in the industry and could decrease injuries.

### Data

Data was pulled from the National Safety Board (NTSB) in which 2563 rows and 38 columns of information was obtained.  After removing null values and column cleanups, 559 rows and 15 columns of data was used to model on.  During the cleaning and EDA phase it was noted that the data entered was more than likely entered by multiple humans so there was inconsistancy with the information and a lot of time was used to clean the data to make it useable.

### Conclusions & Recommendations


Further research could be conducted to confirm that safety performance continues to increase as time goes on. 

Maintain robust data collection to ensure that high-quailty data is available for ongoing analysis. Invest in training employees who work at airlines to mitigate risks of injury to crew and customers.
