### Data

Data was pulled from the National Safety Board (NTSB) in which 2563 rows and 38 columns of information was obtained.  After removing null values and column cleanups, 559 rows and 15 columns of data was used to model on.  During the cleaning and EDA phase it was noted that the data entered was more than likely entered by multiple humans so there was inconsistancy with the information and a lot of time was used to clean the data to make it useable.
