The safety margin was further reduced because of PenAir’s failure to correctly apply its company-designated pilot-in-command airport qualification policy, which allowed the accident captain to operate at one of the most challenging airports in PenAir’s route system with limited experience at the airport and in the Saab 2000 airplane.",,53.898334,-166.54417,Saab,2000,AIR,PADU,Unalaska,FALSE,2,SCHD,,121,Substantial,VMC,"Peninsula AviationServices Inc.,",Completed,FALSE,https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=100437,12/16/2020 18:00

The airplane was susceptible to this loss of control, and the crew was unable to recover.  Contributing to the accident were: 1) the French Directorate General for Civil Aviation's (DGAC's) inadequate oversight of the ATR 42 and 72, and its failure to take the necessary corrective action to ensure continued airworthiness in icing conditions; and 2) the DGAC's failure to provide the FAA with timely airworthiness information developed from previous ATR incidents and accidents in icing conditions,3) the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA's) failure to ensure that aircraft icing certification requirements, operational requirements for flight into icing conditions, and FAA published aircraft icing information adequately accounted for the hazards that can result from flight in freezing rain, 4) the FAA's inadequate oversight of the ATR 42 and 72 to ensure continued airworthiness in icing conditions; and 5) ATR's inadequate response to the continued occurrence of ATR 42 icing/roll upsets which, in conjunction with information learned about aileron control difficulties during the certification and development of the ATR 42 and 72, should have prompted additional  research, and the creation of updated airplane flight manuals, flightcrew operating manuals and training programs related to operation of the ATR 42 and 72 in such icing conditions.",,0,0,ATR,ATR-72-212,AIR,,,FALSE,2,SCHD,UNK,121,Destroyed,IMC,AMERICAN EAGLE AIRLINES,Completed,FALSE,,
